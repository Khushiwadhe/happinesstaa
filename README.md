 The Travel Recommendation System is designed to provide personalized travel recommendations
 based on user preferences such as zone, state, and city. The system uses a dataset containing
 information about various travel destinations in India and employs machine learning models to generate
 recommendations. The project is implemented using Python, Flask, and various machine learning
 libraries. The system is designed to be user-friendly, with a web-based interface that allows users to
 input their preferences and receive tailored travel recommendations.
